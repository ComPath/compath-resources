    "__Summary:__ _A core of aproximately 3800 genes (core gene set) are shared between KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways. In other words, most of the genes are shared between these pathway databases (see Fig. 1). The majority of pathways are covered by the genes shared between the three databases (at least by one gene) (see Fig. 2). Finally, conducting a pathway enrichment using different threshold (minimum number of genes are required to enriched the pathway) to observe how the relative coverage of pathways varies (see Fig. 3)._\n",
