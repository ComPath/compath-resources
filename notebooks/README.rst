- The visualization folder contains notebooks that assist to generate json files necessary for front-end visualizations
- The curation-template folder contains notebooks used to generate the file templates used in the curation exercise.
- The 'img' folder contains external images displayed in notebooks.

This folder different notebooks with analyses using ComPath.

- `Common pathways across databases <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/notebooks/Common%20pathways%20across%20databases.ipynb>`_ elucidates the shared pathways (equivalent) between KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways.
- `Gene-centric coverage of databases <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/notebooks/Gene%20centric%20coverage%20of%20Pathway%20Databases.ipynb>`_ assess the common genes shared between datatabases and how well this common core covers the pathways in each resource.
- `Pathways without mappings <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/notebooks/Pathways%20without%20mappings.ipynb>`_ explores the pathways without any type of mapping with other database
- `Similarity analysis in mapped pathways <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/notebooks/Similarity%20analysis%20in%20mapped%20pathways.ipynb>`_ explores the similarity based on the content between the mappings across KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways.
- `Statistics Pathway Sizes <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/notebooks/Statistics%20Pathway%20Sizes.ipynb>`_ Basic statistics about pathway descriptors and size distributions.
