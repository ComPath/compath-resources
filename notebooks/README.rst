Notebooks
=========

This folder different notebooks with analyses about the curation exercise conducted in ComPath.

- `Common pathways across databases <https://github.com/ComPath/curation/blob/master/notebooks/Common%20pathways%20across%20databases.ipynb>`_ elucidates the shared pathways (equivalent) between KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways. 
- `Gene-centric coverage of databases <https://github.com/ComPath/curation/blob/master/notebooks/Gene%20centric%20coverage%20of%20Pathway%20Databases.ipynb>`_ assess the common genes shared between datatabases and how well this common core covers the pathways in each resource. 
- `Pathways without mappings <https://github.com/ComPath/curation/blob/master/notebooks/Pathways%20without%20mappings.ipynb>`_ explores the pathways without any type of mapping with other database
- `Similarity analysis in mapped pathways <https://github.com/ComPath/curation/blob/master/notebooks/Similarity%20analysis%20in%20mapped%20pathways.ipynb>`_ explores the similarity based on the content between the mappings across KEGG, Reactome, and WikiPathways.
