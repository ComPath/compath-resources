Mapping Between Pathway Databases
==================================

Here you can find pairwise mappings between pathway databases. As of March 2020, `PathBank <https://pathbank.org/>`_
mappings are now available in ComPath.

Each file corresponds to a pairwise mapping between the following databases [*]_:

- `KEGG - WikiPathways <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/mappings/kegg_wikipathways.csv>`_
- `KEGG - Reactome <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/mappings/kegg_reactome.csv>`_
- `WikiPathways - Reactome <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/mappings/wikipathways_reactome.csv>`_
- `PathBank - KEGG <https://github.com/ComPath/compath-resources/blob/master/mappings/pathbank_kegg.csv>`_
